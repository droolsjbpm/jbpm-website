== User role requirement for WebSocket clients to access the built-in Controller in Business Central

Starting this release, if you use WebSocket protocol in your Java client to connect to the built-in Controller in Business Central,
you must configure the client with the `rest-all` user role in order to access the Controller REST API.
This enhancement ensures that WebSocket clients have proper access and security when interacting with the Controller in Business Central.
